In particular the film industry has been one of the most profitable sectors with companies like Netflix and Amazon capitalizing on this to reap great benefits.

BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING
We are going to be taking a look at some data related to movies to try and answer some business questions about different types of movies.
Some of the business questions we are going to be answering include:
What type of movies are most popular
How do different types of movies perform revenue wise both domestically and abroad.
How long should different types of movies be.

Domestic gross-domestic revenue of a movie
Foreign gross-Foreign revenue of a movie
Rating-the average score the consumers gave a movie out of 10
